# this file should be always empty
# when I debug, I read from YML file
# but during actual training, I pass config from bsub script
# the way it works: - it first loads the default configs from the ctrl/config_panop/default.py
# then it upates the configs which are defined in the YML file
# finally it updates the configs which are defined in the bsub script
# now if you mentioned any config here assuming that I don't use anything from here,
# but the problem happens, if you don't define anything assuming that you the script will be used the default config from the default.py
# and mistakely you mention the same config here with a different value than the default,
# then the default config will be overwritten by this value
